# Betway Landing Page - Next.js + Redux + TypeScript

## Live demo:
(https://bet-way-alfonso.vercel.app/)

## Extra Features
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Multistep registration form
- Use of Redux for state management
- Used genAI to create desktop version of the background
- Fireworks animation component for mobile

## What needs improvement
- I should have split the components into smaller ones
- I have done only few tests
- I should have managed more elements in redux
- I could have optimized better the styling

## Getting Started
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
