## Live demo:

(https://bet-way-alfonso.vercel.app/)

## Notes on Code Quality

This project already follows key coding best practices such as clear structure, reusable components, and consistent
styling.  
While there are still a few elements that could be refined or extended, the overall implementation aims to demonstrate
solid principles of clean and maintainable code.

## Extra Features

- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Multistep registration form
- Use of Redux for state management
- Used genAI to create desktop version of the background
- Fireworks animation component for mobile

## What needs improvement

- png background images are not optimized. Instead of a transparent png I would have used an svg cutout
- I should have split the components into smaller ones
- I have done only few tests
- I should have managed more elements in redux
- I could have optimized better the styling

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
